Changelog:

19/01/2011 v0.2.9
	- b_pyramid now strict (tested with sigma-based players)
	- Profile-strict reframes calculation (was: safest value)
	- Main profile for SD encodes, High for HD. Level strict:
		576p: Main@3.1, 720p: High@4.0, 1080p: High@4.1
	- adding --compression <TID>:none for a/v tracks -- most
		hardware players die when zlib is used. This
		is to allow mkvtoolnix 4.2+ compatibility.
	- BUGFIX: SUBTITLE_SUCCESS_COUNT now correctly created
		when using existing files (s/cat/wc -l)
	- Allow resume if there is not enough space for mkvmerge phase
	- BUGFIX: Protect against whitespace in variables
	- removed defunct email of SevenOf29
	- welcome new contributor (GS), copyright notice updated

16/04/2010 v0.2.8 (not released for some bizarre reason)
	- further optimisations for ripping directly from DVDs:
		* cache metadata
		* eject when dumpstreams are done
	- minor tweak to drive unlocking (now playing 0 frames)
	- preliminary support for resuming: RESUME=1 to enable
		(see README FAQ:2 for more details)
	- crop detection moved back to the encoding step
	- SHORTEST_FIRST=2 now preserves the title numerical order
	- EXIT_AFTER_DUMP=[0|1] and EJECT_AFTER_DUMP=[0|1] now control
		what happends when dumping finishes.

15/04/2010 v0.2.7
	- script checks for $PREDEFINED_CROP and if present, skips crop 
		detection (useful for overrides) ="X:Y:W:H"
	- BUGFIX: eject command for Mac minor issue fixed

13/04/2010 v0.2.6
	- speed improvement when ripping directly from a DVD (dumpstream)

02/02/2010 v0.2.5
	- No longer loading autoripper.conf from current directory (./)
	- Bugfix - more cleanup mess (oh the irony)
	- ripper.sh: added "drutil eject" compatibility for MacOS X

07/01/2010 v0.2.4a
	- Bugfix - variable evaluation at the end of encode, affects cleanup.
	- Bugfix - removed overzealous cleanup

15/12/2009 v0.2.4
	- fully implemented seq compatibility for MacOS X
	- if no ~/.autoripper.conf found, it will be created
		using built-in defaults
	- base CRF is now a configuration option (default 18)

07/12/2009 v0.2.3
	- error handling for bizarre frame rates (thanks Lionel!)
	- corrected rounding error for 41.(6)ms (41.667 now)
	- changed variable order in autoripper.conf, added comment which ones
		to edit at minimum (backwards compatible)
	- added quickstart guide in README
	BUGS: README still rubbish (help anyone?).

27/11/2009 v0.2.2
	- changed config file loading order to something more sane (~/.dotfile
		has highest priority now. local dir -> etc -> dotfile.
	- upsampling/downsampling now stable and merged in the config file.
	- THREADS (default "auto") controls the number of x264 encoding threads

11/11/2009 v0.2.1b
	Bugfix release
	- gseq doesn't work on MacOS X.

11/11/2009 v0.2.1a
	Bugfix release
	- removed old workaround in configuration (never used)
	- fixed ionice command leftover options

10/11/2009 v0.2.1
	- b_pyramid syntax now a configuration option (default: new syntax)
	- now compatible with MacOS X (seq/gseq/builtin function), use
		http://macports.org to get the dependencies.
	- ionice now used only if present, otherwise ignored
	- both input and output FPS now defined and enforced
	- added FORCE_PULLUP=2 (now default). It will now pull entire movie 
		down first using "softpulldown" and then do a strict pullup
		using ivtc=2, _should_ work better for completely messed up 
		NTSC DVDs and since ivtc=2 enforces 5:4 ratio, in theory there
		should be no audio<->video drift.

27/10/2009 v0.2.0
	- 1080p -> 720p downsample option
	- crswallow moved to http://code.google.com/p/crswallow/
	- change in -x264encopts syntax (was: nob_pyramid, is: b_pyramid=none)
		in mencoder >= SVN-r29796

15/10/2009 v0.1.9
	- added further tool output surpression with optional crswallow  
		(included).

15/10/2009 v0.1.8
	- more variable quoting fixes
	- added m2ts transcoding (supports both 720p and 1080p)
		NOTE: Audio/Sub tracks will not have correct
		language information in this mode -- there isn't any data to 
		process. There is no chapter support in this mode either 
		(same as vob mode).
	
08/10/2009 v0.1.7
	- vob file processing (concaternate multiple vobs first), no language 
		codes support (all "und")
	- grep '[CROP]' bugfix
	- suppress the progress output of mplayer, mencoder, mkvmerge (-quiet)
		(NOPROGRESS=1)
	- cropdetect loop changed from [sample_points]+1 to -1, don't define 
		SAMPLE_POINTS < than 3.
	- .partial filenames, that will get renamed only after a command 
		completes
	- keep and reuse dump files from a previous aborted run. NOCLEANUP=1
	- moved the crop detection further up
	- SAMPLING_DIVIDER allows using a fraction of title length to sample 
		cropping. Useful for dd_rescue'd isos.
	- multiple variable quoting bugfixes.
	- files have neater permissions now.

05/10/2009 v0.1.6
	- Preliminary support for automatic CRF adjustment based on the
		source bitrate. See README for more details. Off by
		default. You must define DEFAULT_SOURCE_BASED_CRF
		in your autoripper.conf.
	- Handling of badly mastered DVDs that report subtitles
		present, but don't contain any.

25/09/2009 v0.1.5a
	- Fixed NTSC pulldown bug, added FORCED_PULLUP variable (on by
		default). Disable if you're ripping truly interlaced
		content (instead of pulled down NTSC).

25/09/2009 v0.1.5
	- Backwards compatibility broken, re-create your autoripper.conf!
	- Changed configuration settings priority (export -> config -> 
		script built in)
	- Command output redirected to STDERR
	- Added detection of incorrectly mastered DVDs with 0 audio tracks
		in the structure (but with default track working)
	- Minor quoting fixes
	- SID and AID indexes now only incremented on successfull extract
	BUGS: pulldown (NTSC) encodes still need work

24/09/2009 v0.1.4
	- added second parameter (optional) to supply TITLE_PREFIX
	- improved handling of "Unknown" disk titles (now using DISC_ID)
		for both x264transcode and ripper.sh
	- removed hardcoded /usr/bin paths

17/09/2009 v0.1.3b
	- bugfix (-noautosub needs to be before dvd:// otherwise subs get
		hardcoded into the stream)

16/09/2009 v0.1.3a
	- bugfix (type'o)

16/09/2009 v0.1.3
	- Quality setting (HIGH is default, MEDIUM and LOW producing smaller
		files)

		(thanks Epon!)
